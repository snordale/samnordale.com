                            <p class='section-content'>Hub is a mobile app that facilitates student engagement 
                                in campus organizations by enabling them to find, join, organize, and propose 
                                organizations a central location.<br><br>
                                Features include a recommendation engine to suggest groups that students are 
                                likely to join, as well as a system to propose new organizations that can 
                                alleviate the overhead effort required to start an on-campus organization.</p>

                            <p class='section-content'>Currently, most student run organizations rely on 
                                Facebook or Group Messaging, which arenâ€™t tailored for organization leaders. 
                                By offering features that allow leaders to create events, send updates, assign 
                                tasks, and manage group members, Hub will create immense value for the people 
                                most involved in the student-organization ecosystem. 
                                <br><br>
                                Once organization leaders join, the members of their groups will have to join, 
                                and after seeing the convenience of consolidating organization info, ask for 
                                the service in the other groups they participate in.</p>
